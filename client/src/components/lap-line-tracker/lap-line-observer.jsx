// The Lap-line observer has been given a tablet which may be used in landscape or portrait.
// Their interface requires 1 button for each car which will be pressed as the respective car passes the lap-line.
// The button must simply have the car's number on it.
// As many cars cross the lap-line quickly and often, the buttons must be very hard to miss (they must occupy a large tappable area).

// Cars can still cross the lap line when the race is in finish mode.
// The observer's display should show a message to indicate that the race session is ended once that has been declared by the Safety Official.
// The buttons must not function after the race is ended. They should disappear or be visually disabled.
