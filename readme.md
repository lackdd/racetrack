# Beachside Racetrack - Real-Time Race Management System

## Overview

The Beachside Racetrack system is designed to manage races in real time, ensuring smooth operation and providing up-to-date information for employees, race drivers, and spectators. Built using **Node.js**, **React**, and **Socket.IO**, it supports multiple personas and features dynamic race management interfaces.

This project was made in collaboration with Andre Berezin and Artur Stoljar. I was assigned to create the frontend and backend parts of /race-control and /front-desk so my task included figuring out the whole dynamic of race and race-driver creation and control logic, which needed a lot of backend data transfer. I also came up with the style for the buttons, text in race-control, front-desk and leaderboard and set up mongodb Atlas as our remote database.

4. MongoDB setup

   ### MongoDB setup guide

   #### Step 1: Create a MongoDB Atlas Account
   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com) and sign up for a free account.

   - Click Allow Access from Anywhere (or specify your IP for security).
   - Click Confirm to save.

   #### Step 5: Get Your Connection String
   - In the Clusters section, click Connect > Connect Your Application.
   - Copy the provided connection string, which looks like this:
   ```bash
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@racetrack-cluster.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
   - Replace <username>, <password>, and <dbname> with your details.

   #### Step 6: Add MongoDB URI to .env File
   - Open your .env file and update the MONGO_URI variable:
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://your_username:your_password@racetrack-cluster.mongodb.net/racetrackDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
   - Save the file.

5. Ngrok setup (OPTIONAL)
### Ngrok Setup Guide

#### What is Ngrok?
Ngrok is a tool that creates secure tunnels to localhost, allowing your local server to be accessible via a public URL. It is especially useful for testing webhooks or sharing your local development server with team members.

#### Step 1: Install Ngrok

1. **Download Ngrok**:
    - Visit the [official Ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download) and download the version suitable for your operating system.

2. **Install Ngrok**:
    - Extract the downloaded file and move it to a directory in your system's `PATH`.
    - Test the installation:
      ```bash
      ngrok --version
      ```
    - You should see the installed version printed in your terminal.

#### Step 2: Create an Ngrok Account and Set Up Authtoken

1. **Sign Up for an Ngrok Account**:
    - Go to the [Ngrok sign-up page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) and create an account.

2. **Retrieve Your Authtoken**:
    - After logging in, navigate to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) and copy your unique authtoken.

3. **Set Up Authtoken**:
    - Run the following command in your terminal:
      ```bash
      ngrok config add-authtoken <your-authtoken>
      ```
    - Replace `<your-authtoken>` with the token from your Ngrok dashboard.
    - Add the token to the keys.env file.

#### Step 3: Configure Ngrok for Your Racetrack Application

1. **Edit the `.ngrok.yml` Configuration File**:
    - In the root directory of your project, edit the file named `.ngrok.yml`. Replace the authtoken with your unique authtoken. 

---

6. Start the server:
   - Development Mode (default 1-minute races):
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Production Mode (default 10-minute races):
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
     
   - Copy the provided ngrok url form your terminal into your browser. You will see the ngrok warning page where you can press "visit site".
